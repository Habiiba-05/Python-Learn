# Modules 

# Modules are when I create separate files,
# where each file has a certain functionality 
# that I will need to use often.
# Instead of putting everything in one single file,
# I split them into different files
# to make coding easier for me.

# The file I want to import must be in the same folder

import name
print(name.fname("habiba"))


# In the case of this statement, I use it when I have many methods in the file,
# so I can specify exactly which one I want to import

from name import fname
print(name.fname("habiba"))
