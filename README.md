# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my Python learning notes and exercises.  
I am currently learning Python, so all projects and exercises are for practice purposes.  

It includes:

- Notes on basic Python concepts
- Small code exercises and projects
- Practice with variables, data types, and control statements

I will update this repository as I progress in learning Python.
